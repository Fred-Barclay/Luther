# LUTHER
This is a collection of Martin Luther's prefaces to books of the Bible. If I can
find other works by him I'll add them to the repo as well.

### Sources
The prefaces come from the Luther module to Xiphos. I copied the text and
converted the .pdf files verbatim, except for when a correction clearly needed
to be made. Pending the items in TODO, there will be future changes and
corrections.

### Licensing
I pass these on as I received them: to the public domain. If they help you I
would appreciate a mention but you are free to use these as you like. :-)
